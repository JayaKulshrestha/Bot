intelligent agent.\\npart of a series on\\nartificial intelligence\\n\\nmajor goals\\napproaches\\nphilosophy\\nhistory\\ntechnology\\nglossary\\nvte\\nartificial intelligence (ai) is the intelligence of machines or softwares, as opposed to the intelligence of human beings or animals. ai applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., google search), recommendation systems (used by youtube, amazon, and netflix), understanding human speech (such as siri and alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., waymo), generative or creative tools (chatgpt and ai art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and go).[1][2]\\n\\nartificial intelligence, that has emerged as an academic discipline in 1956, went through multiple cycles of unsubstantiated optimism (aka hype)[3][4][5][6][7] followed by failures and subsequently losing funds in several ai winters.[8][9][7][10]\\n\\neconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[11]\\n\\napproaches\\nreplacing the initial goal (i.e. using highly formalized rule-based, step-by-step reasoning) with the seemingly less ambitious goal of probabilistic learning from experience has been backed up by evidence that humans most of the time use fast (either instinctive or \"intuitive\", i.e. probabilistic) judgments, too.[12]\\n\\nfailure of rule-based approach\\nrule-based step-by-step approach that was successful in highly formalized circumstances, such as in solving puzzles or making logical deductions, failed to provide useful results in more probabilistic, real-world circumstances.[13]\\n\\nneither methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, such as used in probability and rational-choice economics, nor the computation power was available until the late 1980s and 1990s.[14]\\n\\ndeep learning, especially large language models, has only begun to be possible using faster hardware, such as gpus in late 2010s and early 2020s, as a result of both hardware improvements (faster computers,[15] graphics processing units, cloud computing[10]) and access to large amounts of data[16] (including curated datasets,[10] such as imagenet and vast textual corpora).\\n\\nhighly formalized knowledge representation\\nmain articles: knowledge representation, commonsense knowledge, description logic, and ontology (information science)\\ninspired by highly formalized mathematics, the researchers initially attempted to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[17][18] situations, events, states and time;[19] causes and effects;[20] knowledge about knowledge [21] (what we know about what other people know); and default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing), in a highly formalized way.[22]\\n\\nlearning\\nmain article: machine learning\\nafter the failure of ai to deliver results useful in real-world circumstances, a more pragmatic research, known as \"machine learning\", began to focus on probabilistic approaches that were previously not a focus of the field.[a][25]\\n\\nunsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[26]\\n\\nsupervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and regression.[27] [28]\\n\\nin reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.[29]\\n\\ntransfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[30]\\n\\ncomputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[31]\\n\\nnatural language processing\\nmain article: natural language processing\\nnatural language processing[32] begun in the 1960s as part of symbolic ai, using highly formalized syntax to translate the human sentences into logical ones. as already mentioned, this approach failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[33] and the vastness of knowledge.[34]\\n\\nonly with advent of deep learning approaches in late 2010s and early 2020s,[35], especially the generative pre-trained transformers (or \"gpts\"), the models began to generate coherent text,[36][37] and by 2023 begun to get human-level scores on the bar exam, sat, gre, and many other real-world applications.[38]\\n\\nperception\\n\\nfeature detection (pictured: edge detection) helps ai compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.\\nmachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals,active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world. computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[39] the field includes speech recognition,[40] image classification,[41] facial recognition, object recognition,[42] robotic perception,[43] among others.\\n\\nsocial intelligence\\nmain article: affective computing\\n\\nkismet, a robot with rudimentary social skills[44]\\naffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[45] for example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. however, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[46] moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein ai classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[47]\\n\\ngeneral intelligence\\nmain article: artificial general intelligence\\na machine with general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[48]\\n\\ntools\\nlogic\\nmain articles: logic programming and automated reasoning\\nlogic[49] is used for highly formalized kinds of knowledge representation and problem-solving, but it can be applied to other areas as well, although it is not effective in real-world circumstances where faster, probabilistic reasoning is required.\\n\\nsearch and optimization\\nmain articles: search algorithm, mathematical optimization, and evolutionary computation\\nthe goal of learning, i.e. finding and applying useful solutions to a problem, can be achieved by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[50] however, because the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers, such a search doesn\\'t deliver results in a timely fashion. often \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" are needed to prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps.\\n\\n\\na particle swarm seeking the global minimum\\na very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. for many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top.\\n\\nevolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. for example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).\\n\\nalternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[51]\\n\\nprobabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning\\nmain articles: bayesian network, hidden markov model, kalman filter, particle filter, decision theory, and utility theory\\n\\nexpectation-maximization clustering of old faithful eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.\\nmany problems in ai (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[52]\\n\\nprobabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden markov models or kalman filters).[53]\\n\\nprecise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[54] and information value theory.[55] these tools include models such as markov decision processes,[56] dynamic decision networks,[53] game theory and mechanism design.[57]\\n\\nclassifiers and statistical learning methods\\nmain articles: statistical classification and machine learning\\nthe simplest ai applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. controllers can, however, perform also the classification of the conditions before choosing an action to be implemented.\\n\\nclassifiers, on the other hand, are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. they can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples, which makes them very useful.\\n\\na machine learning classifier can use either statistical or artificial neural networks approaches[58], and its performance depends on the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, dimensionality, and the level of noise.[59]\\n\\nartificial neural networks\\nmain articles: artificial neural network and connectionism\\n\\na neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.\\nmodern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. they can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations. neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization – they perform gradient descent on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network. the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[60] other learning techniques for neural networks are hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), gmdh or competitive learning.[61]\\n\\nthe main categories of networks include feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events).\\n\\ndeep learning\\nrepresenting images on multiple layers of abstraction in deep learning\\nrepresenting images on multiple layers of abstraction in deep learning[62]\\ndeep learning[63] uses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. the multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. for example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[64]\\n\\ndeep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[65] and others.\\n\\nspecialized hardware and software\\nmain articles: programming languages for artificial intelligence and hardware for artificial intelligence\\nin late 2010s, graphics processing units (gpus) that were increasingly designed with ai-specific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (cpus) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training.[66]\\n\\nhistorically, specialized languages, such as lisp, prolog, and others, had been used.\\n\\napplications\\nmain article: applications of artificial intelligence\\nsee also: embodied cognition and legal informatics\\n\\nfor this 2018 project of the artist joseph ayerle the ai had to learn the typical patterns in the colors and brushstrokes of renaissance painter raphael. the portrait shows the face of the actress ornella muti, \"painted\" by ai in the style of raphael.\\nin the late 2010s and early 2020s, machine learning applications found their use in search engines (such as google search), targeting online advertisements,[67] recommendation systems (offered by netflix, youtube or amazon), driving internet traffic,[68][69] targeted advertising (adsense, facebook), virtual assistants (such as siri or alexa),[70] autonomous vehicles (including drones, adas and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (microsoft translator, google translate), facial recognition (apple\\'s face id or microsoft\\'s deepface), image labeling (used by facebook, apple\\'s iphoto and tiktok), spam filtering and chatbots (such as chatgpt).\\n\\nin the early 2020s, generative ai gained widespread prominence. chatgpt, based on gpt-3, and other large language models, were tried by 14% of americans adults.[71]\\n\\nin 2023, the increasing realism and ease-of-use of ai-based text-to-image generators such as midjourney, dall-e, and stable diffusion[72][73] sparked a trend of viral ai-generated photos. widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of pope francis wearing a white puffer coat,[74] the fictional arrest of donald trump,[75] and a hoax of an attack on the pentagon,[76] as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[77][78]\\n\\nthere are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions. a few examples are energy storage,[79] deepfakes,[80] medical diagnosis, military logistics, foreign policy,[81] or supply chain management.\\n\\nin the 2010s, experimental applications were developed, such as deepmind\\'s model that could learn many diverse atari games on its own[82] and alphafold 2 (2020), which demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3d structure of a protein.[83] other applications predict the result of judicial decisions,[84] create art (such as poetry or painting) and prove mathematical theorems.\\n\\nintellectual property\\n\\nai patent families for functional application categories and sub categories. computer vision represents 49 percent of patent families related to a functional application in 2016.\\nin 2019, wipo reported that ai was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents, the internet of things was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size. it was followed, again in market size, by big data technologies, robotics, ai, 3d printing and the fifth generation of mobile services (5g).[85] since ai emerged in the 1950s, 340,000 ai-related patent applications were filed by innovators and 1.6 million scientific papers have been published by researchers, with the majority of all ai-related patent filings published since 2013. companies represent 26 out of the top 30 ai patent applicants, with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four.[86] the ratio of scientific papers to inventions has significantly decreased from 8:1 in 2010 to 3:1 in 2016, which is attributed to be indicative of a shift from theoretical research to the use of ai technologies in commercial products and services. machine learning is the dominant ai technique disclosed in patents and is included in more than one-third of all identified inventions (134,777 machine learning patents filed for a total of 167,038 ai patents filed in 2016), with computer vision being the most popular functional application. ai-related patents not only disclose ai techniques and applications, they often also refer to an application field or industry. twenty application fields were identified in 2016 and included, in order of magnitude: telecommunications (15 percent), transportation (15 percent), life and medical sciences (12 percent), and personal devices, computing and human–computer interaction (11 percent). other sectors included banking, entertainment, security, industry and manufacturing, agriculture, and networks (including social networks, smart cities and the internet of things). ibm has the largest portfolio of ai patents with 8,290 patent applications, followed by microsoft with 5,930 patent applications.[86]\\n\\nhistory\\nmain articles: history of artificial intelligence and timeline of artificial intelligence\\nnot counting the ancient precursors of mechanical reasoning in mythology, philosophy, and mathematics, advances in the modern mathematical logic led directly to alan turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the church–turing thesis.[87] this, along with at the time new discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of using electronic components to simulate human problem-solving.[88]\\n\\nwritten in 1943 by mccullouch and pitts, the formal design for turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" is generally recognized as the first paper in ai.[89]\\n\\nmore than a decade later, in 1956, the field of ai research was officially born at a workshop at dartmouth college.[b][91] the attendees[c] and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[d] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking english.[e][94]\\n\\nby the middle of the 1960s, research in the u.s. was heavily funded by the department of defense[95] and laboratories had been established around the world.[96] herbert simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[97] marvin minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[98]\\n\\nthey have, however, underestimated the vastness and probabilistic nature of most human knowledge,[34] implicit in the \"remaining\" tasks.[f]\\n\\nboth the u.s. and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill[100] and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects. additionally, minsky\\'s and papert\\'s book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[101] the \"ai winter\", a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult, followed.[8]\\n\\nin the early 1980s, ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[102] a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. by 1985, the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars. at the same time, japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the u.s. and british governments to restore funding for academic research.[7] however, beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987, ai once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[9]\\n\\nmany researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition.[103] a number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific machine learning problems.[104] robotics researchers, such as rodney brooks, rejected the discredited rule-based approaches and trained robots that learned to move in their environment based on sensory information[g], using reasonable guesses (known as \"soft computing\") to deal with uncertain sensory information.[109]\\n\\noutside of academic discipline ai, which abandoned artificial neural networks altogether from its toolbox until the 1990s, people from other disciplines, such as psychologist geoffrey hinton and david rumelhart, kept it alive under the name \"connectionism\".[110]\\n\\nin the 1990s, yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, which made the neural networks approach a \"safe choice\" again.[111]\\n\\nin the late 1990s and early 2000s, advanced mathematical methods and specific solutions to specific problems has emerged as a new academic discipline named machine learning. machine learning researchers produced verifiable results and collaborated with other fields, such as statistics, economics and mathematics, culminating in deep learning. deep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[15] graphics processing units, cloud computing[10]) and access to large amounts of data[16] (including curated datasets,[10] such as imagenet).\\n\\ndeep learning soon proved to be highly successful at a wide range of tasks and was adopted throughout the field. for many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[h]\\n\\nthe machine learning achievements made it safe for media and businesses to refer to them as \"ai\" again. [i] the number of software projects that use machine learning at google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects in 2015.[10]\\n\\nin a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated \"ai\" in some offerings or processes\".[113] the amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[114] according to \\'ai impacts\\', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"ai\" around 2022 in the us alone and about 20% of new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in \"ai\";[115] about 800,000 \"ai\"-related us job openings existed in 2022.[116]\\n\\nin 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[117]\\n\\nphilosophy\\nmain article: philosophy of artificial intelligence\\ndefining artificial intelligence\\nmain articles: turing test, intelligent agent, dartmouth workshop, and synthetic intelligence\\nalan turing wrote in 1950 \"i propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[118] he advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[118] he devised the turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[119] since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[j] but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"[120]\\n\\nrussell and norvig agree with turing that ai must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\".[121] however, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[122] ai founder john mccarthy agreed, writing that \"artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[123]\\n\\nmccarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\"[124] another ai founder, marvin minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[125] these definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\n\\na definition that has also been adopted by google[126][better source needed] – major practitionary in the field of ai. this definition stipulated the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\n\\nevaluating approaches to ai\\nno established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history.[k] the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). this approach is mostly sub-symbolic, neat, soft and narrow (see below). critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers.\\n\\nsymbolic ai and its limits\\nsymbolic ai (or \"gofai\")[128] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. they were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or iq tests. in the 1960s, newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[129]\\n\\nhowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for ai, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[130] philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[131] although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, ai research came to agree.[l][12]\\n\\nthe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[133][134] in part because sub-symbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision. the emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\nneat vs. scruffy\\nmain article: neats and scruffies\\n\"neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely only on incremental testing to see if they work. this issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,[135] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. in the 1990s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm, a transition that russell and norvig termed in 2003 as \"the victory of the neats\".[136] however in 2020 they wrote \"deep learning may represent a resurgence of the scruffies\".[103] modern ai has elements of both.\\n\\nsoft vs. hard computing\\nmain article: soft computing\\nfinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[33] soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. soft computing was introduced in the late 80s and most successful ai programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\nnarrow vs. general ai\\nmain article: artificial general intelligence\\nai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence (general ai) directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow ai) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[137][138] general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. the experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\nmachine consciousness, sentience and mind\\nmain articles: philosophy of artificial intelligence and artificial consciousness\\nthe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field. stuart russell and peter norvig observe that most ai researchers \"don\\'t care about the [philosophy of ai] – as long as the program works, they don\\'t care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\"[139] however, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\nconsciousness\\nmain articles: hard problem of consciousness and theory of mind\\ndavid chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[140] the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. for example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[141]\\n\\ncomputationalism and functionalism\\nmain articles: computational theory of mind, functionalism (philosophy of mind), and chinese room\\ncomputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam.[142]\\n\\nphilosopher john searle characterized this position as \"strong ai\": \"the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[m] searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.[145]\\n\\nrobot rights\\nmain article: robot rights\\nif a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights.[146] any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.[147] this issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,[148] and is now being considered by, for example, california\\'s institute for the future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.[149]\\n\\nfuture\\nsuperintelligence\\nmain articles: superintelligence, technological singularity, and transhumanism\\na superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[138]\\n\\nif research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. the improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement.[150] its intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans. science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario the \"singularity\".[151] because it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.[152]\\n\\nrobot designer hans moravec, cyberneticist kevin warwick, and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. this idea, called transhumanism, has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger.[153]\\n\\nedward fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by samuel butler\\'s \"darwin among the machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.[154]\\n\\nrisks\\ntechnological unemployment\\nmain articles: workplace impact of artificial intelligence and technological unemployment\\nin the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with ai.[155] a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[156] risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated 47% of u.s. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an oecd report classified only 9% of u.s. jobs as \"high risk\".[n][158] the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology (rather than social policy) creates unemployment (as opposed to redundancies).[11]\\n\\nunlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; the economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that ai could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the industrial revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[159] jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[160]\\n\\nbad actors and weaponized ai\\nmain articles: lethal autonomous weapon, artificial intelligence arms race, and ai safety\\nai provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes aid in producing misinformation; advanced ai can make centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.[161]\\n\\nterrorists, criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized ai such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons. by 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[162]\\n\\nmachine-learning ai is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[163]\\n\\nalgorithmic bias\\nmain article: algorithmic bias\\nai programs can become biased after learning from real-world data.[164] it may not be introduced by the system designers but learned by the program, and thus the programmers may not be aware that the bias exists.[165] bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[166] [164] it can also emerge from correlations: ai is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group. in some cases, this assumption may be unfair.[167] an example of this is compas, a commercial program widely used by u.s. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. propublica claims that the compas-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.[168]\\n\\nhealth equity issues may also be exacerbated when many-to-many mapping is done without taking steps to ensure equity for populations at risk for bias. at this time equity-focused tools and regulations are not in place to ensure equity application representation and usage.[169] other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when ai is used for credit rating, cv screening, hiring and applications for public housing.[164]\\n\\nat its 2022 conference on fairness, accountability, and transparency (acm facct 2022) the association for computing machinery, in seoul, south korea, presented and published findings recommending that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[170]\\n\\nexistential risk\\nmain articles: existential risk from artificial general intelligence, ai alignment, and ai safety\\nit has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. this could, as the physicist stephen hawking puts it, \"spell the end of the human race\".[171] according to the philosopher nick bostrom, for almost any goals that a sufficiently intelligent ai may have, it is instrumentally incentivized to protect itself from being shut down and to acquire more resources, as intermediary steps to better achieve these goals. sentience or emotions are then not required for an advanced ai to be dangerous. in order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[172] the political scientist charles t. rubin argued that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence\" and warned that we should not be confident that intelligent machines will by default treat us favorably.[173]\\n\\nthe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai.[174] personalities such as stephen hawking, bill gates, elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai.[175] in 2023, ai pioneers including geoffrey hinton, yoshua bengio, demis hassabis, and sam altman issued the joint statement that \"mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\"; some others such as yann lecun consider this to be unfounded.[176] mark zuckerberg stated that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans.[177] some experts have argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research, or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[178] rodney brooks, in particular, said in 2014 that \"malevolent\" ai is still centuries away.[o]\\n\\ncopyright\\nfurther information: artificial intelligence and copyright\\nin order to leverage as large a dataset as is feasible, generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of \"fair use\". experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[180]\\n\\nethical machines\\nmain articles: machine ethics, ai safety, friendly artificial intelligence, artificial moral agents, and human compatible\\nfriendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. eliezer yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk.[181]\\n\\nmachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[182] the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[182] and was founded at an aaai symposium in 2005.[183]\\n\\nother approaches include wendell wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[184] and stuart j. russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[185]\\n\\nregulation\\nmain articles: regulation of artificial intelligence, regulation of algorithms, and ai safety\\nsam altman seated in front of microphone\\nopenai ceo sam altman testifies about ai regulation before a us senate subcommittee, 2023\\nthe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (ai); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[186] the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[187] according to ai index at stanford, the annual number of ai-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[188][189] between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai.[114] most eu member states had released national ai strategies, as had canada, china, india, japan, mauritius, the russian federation, saudi arabia, united arab emirates, us and vietnam. others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy, including bangladesh, malaysia and tunisia.[114] the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june 2020, stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[114] henry kissinger, eric schmidt, and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate ai.[190] in 2023, openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[191]\\n\\nin a 2022 ipsos survey, attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country; 78% of chinese citizens, but only 35% of americans, agreed that \"products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks\".[188] a 2023 reuters/ipsos poll found that 61% of americans agree, and 22% disagree, that ai poses risks to humanity.[192] in a 2023 fox news poll, 35% of americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate ai, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[193][194]\\n\\nin fiction\\nmain article: artificial intelligence in fiction\\n\\nthe word \"robot\" itself was coined by karel čapek in his 1921 play r.u.r., the title standing for \"rossum\\'s universal robots\".\\nthought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[195] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[196]\\n\\na common trope in these works began with mary shelley\\'s frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. this includes such works as arthur c. clarke\\'s and stanley kubrick\\'s 2001: a space odyssey (both 1968), with hal 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship, as well as the terminator (1984) and the matrix (1999). in contrast, the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still (1951) and bishop from aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[197]\\n\\nisaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[198] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[199]\\n\\nseveral works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. this appears in karel čapek\\'s r.u.r., the films a.i. artificial intelligence and ex machina, as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep?, by philip k. dick. dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[200]\\n\\nsee also\\nai safety – research area on making ai safe and beneficial\\nai alignment – conformance to the intended objective\\nartificial intelligence

machinery and intelligence\".[23] in 1956, at the original dartmouth ai summer conference, ray solomonoff wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"an inductive inference machine\".[24]\\n daniel crevier wrote, \"the conference is generally recognized as the official birthdate of the new science.\"[90] russell and norvig called the conference \"the inception of artificial intelligence.\"[89]\\n russell and norvig wrote \"for the next 20 years the field would be dominated by these people and their students.\"[92]\\n russell and norvig wrote \"it was

championed by hans moravec[106] and rodney brooks[107] and went by many names: nouvelle ai,[107] developmental robotics,[108]\\n matteo wong wrote in the atlantic: \"whereas for decades, computer-science fields such as natural-language processing, computer vision, and robotics used extremely different methods, now they all use a programming method called “deep learning.” as a result, their code and approaches have become more similar, and their models are easier to integrate into one another.\"[112]\\n jack clark wrote in bloomberg: \"after a half-decade of quiet breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, 2015 has been a landmark year. computers are smarter and learning faster than ever.\"[10]\\n see problem of other minds\\n nils nilsson wrote in 1983: \"simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what ai is all about.\"[127]\\n daniel crevier wrote that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of dreyfus\\'s comments. had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\"[132]\\n searle presented this definition of \"strong ai\" in 1999.[143] searle\\'s original formulation was \"the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.\"[144] strong ai is defined similarly by russell and norvig: \"the assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the \\'weak ai\\' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the \\'strong ai\\' hypothesis.\"[139]\\n see table 4; 9% is both the oecd average and the us average.[157]\\n rodney brooks writes, \"i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years. i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"[179]\\nreferences\\n google (2016).\\n gertner, jon (18 july 2023). \"wikipedia\\'s moment of truth - can the online encyclopedia help teach a.i. chatbots to get their facts right —
